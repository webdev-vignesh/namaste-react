### 1. What is Emmet?
Emmet is a web-developers toolkit for boosting HTML and CSS code writing.
It can be added to our code editor which allows us to type shortcuts that are then expanded into small pieces of code.
It is used to create a HTML boilerplate code with '!' shortcut.

### 2. Difference between a library and framework?
Library is a set of functions and classes that can be used by the developer in any part of their code based on the neccessity.
Framework provides a structure in which all the operations and code has to happen.

The key difference between them is the "Inversion of control".
When we call a method from a library, we are in control. But in framework the control is inverted i.e. the framework calls us.

### 3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a group of geographically distributed servers that speed up the delivery of web content by bringing it closer to where users are.
We use CDN's since they provide low latency and high transfer speeds.

### 4. Why is React known as React?
React is know as React because it 'reacts' to changes made in the frontend by the user like clicking, submitting and typing.
