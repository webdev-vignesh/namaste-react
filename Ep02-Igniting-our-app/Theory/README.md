# Episode 02 - Igniting our app

## Theory

### 1. What is NPM?
NPM is many things but not Node Package Manager. NPM is a Open Source package manager for javascript programming language and is the default package manager for nodejs.
NPM helps developers to share and reuse code for building their applications. It involves features such as installing a package, updating, uninstalling and publishing 
a package to the NPM registry where it can be accessed by others and downloaded to use for their projects.

### 2. What is 'Parcel/Webpack'? why do we need it?
Parcel and Webpack are module bundlers, which is used to minify and clean our code for deployment. We need them to improve our application performance,
reduce overall file size by making our code compact.
